Hikma Mobile Application: Server
===============================

This repository contains the server-side code for Hikma Health's mobile application. It is an offline-first EHR system
designed to run on mobile devices and in environments with limited connectivity.

The corresponding client-side code is located at https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-app. Please feel free to file 
feature requests and bugs at either location.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the service is with docker-compose. Once you have installed
Docker and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), you can install
everything with `docker-compose build` and then start the service with
`docker-compose up`.
